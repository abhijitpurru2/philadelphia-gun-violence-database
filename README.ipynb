    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Taken: \n",
    ">Get Response from API:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make calls to the API, an account and user key will be required. A Rapid API account can be made at <https://rapidapi.com/hub>. The specific API is called Newscatcher. Documentation for the API can be found at <https://rapidapi.com/newscatcher-api-newscatcher-api-default/api/newscatcher/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting articles from the API using the `collect_articles` function requires a specified user key and query. Query formatting can be found in the API documentation. The query used for this project is `\"shooting AND Philadelphia\"` which extracts articles that include both \"shooting\" and \"Philadelphia\".\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">Get Desired info from API Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "The response to the API should include whether the call was successful, the number of articles returned, and the number of pages of articles. To get every article, a call will need to be made for each page of articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `extract_article_info` function can be used to extract the information stored in the articles dictionary returned by the API call. Possible extracted information include the article `title`, `author`, `published_date`,  `link`, `summary`, `rights`, `topic`, `country`, `language`, etc. The function will return a dictionary where the key is the category of information (i.e title) and the value is a list of the categories (i.e titles) of each of the articles included in the API call.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">Store Data in Dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dictionary of article info, the `create_dataframe` function can be used to convert the dictionary into a Pandas dataframe. This function also supports masking to remove articles with undesired keywords. To do so, the user should provide a list of undesired keywords and a column name to search for the keywords. For example, if a user wanted to remove articles that contain the word \"76ers\" from the \"summary\" column of the dataframe, the `unwanted_topic` would be `[\"76ers\"]` and the `column_name` would be `\"summary\"`.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">Scraping Keywords and Links:\n",
    "\n",
    "To scrape the articles returned by the API for keywords and links that link to other news articles, the `scrape_keywords` and `scrape_external_links` can be used. It is important to note that the links of the articles to be scraped must be in a column titled 'link' within the dataframe. Some websites do not allow for scraping, which returns a \"Forbidden\" error. More investigation is required to determine other methods of scraping for these websites. For the purposes of this project, the websites that didn't allow for scraping return an empty list of keywords and an empty set of external links.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">Exporting data as a CSV or Excel Spreadsheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "To save and export the resulting dataset as a CSV or Excel Spreadsheet, the `colab_to_csv` or `colab_to_excel` functions can be used. These functions will download the dataframe to your computer in the desired format.\n",

    "> Retrieve Data From Website: \n",
    "\n",
    " The link (<https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents>) was used to find the crime dataset of all crime in Philadelphia. It was found using the OpenDataPhilly website. The dataset has information of crimes spanning from 2006 to current day. Each year is divided into CSV files for each year. The CSV file for 2021 is constantly being updated everyday, so the information is fresh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `scrape_website_links` function, the BeautifulSoup object for the website was retrieved for later use. Since there were multiple CSVs for the data, `years_links` function was used to find the links of the each CSV file. Using this link however, didn't lead to downloading the CSV. The links lead to another page where there was a link to download the CSV. Using `csv_links` function, the download links were scraped. \n",
    "\n",
    "`download_csvs` function was used to download each year's CSV file and that was loaded onto local storage inside the `crime_data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Combine Data and Create Dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the year CSVs downloaded, the `create_pandas_dataframe` function can be used to combine all the data into one workable dataframe. First, from each CSV, only the `dispatch_date_time`, `text_general_code`, `lat` and `lng` columns were used. Each year data was then loaded into a dataframe and then appended to the complete dataframe called `full_list`. The names of the columns were changed to `dispatch_time`, `crime_type`, `latitude` and `longitude`. The `dispatch_time` was changed to datetime format. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cleaning Data and Finding Vital Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the data was combined, it can be finally be cleaned. First, the `crime_type_database` function was used to find the unique crime types in the dataset. From that data, it was determined that there were specific crime types that related to the use of firearms. Unfortunately, the crime types `Homicide - Criminal`, `Homicide - Justifiable` and `Homicide - Gross Negligence` don't specify if it happened with/without a gun. These crime types had to be dropped due to this problem. Using `return_firearm_data` function, the dataframe was cleaned to have only firearm related crimes. The keyword of `Firearm` was included and the keyword of `No` was not included. This cleaning brought the data from about 2.7 million to about 90 thousand data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Showing Use Case of Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of the cleaned dataset, the data points can be displayed on a map to show as an example. Using the `geopandas` and `shapely` libraries, the crimes that related to firearms can be plotted on a map. The `create_map` function used the `latitude` and `longitude` from the dataset to plot red dots on where the crime happened. The map created using `map.shp` which was also obtained from OpenDataPhilly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Export Data to CSV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dataframe was saved to local storage as a CSV file using the `save_data` function. This makes it possible to load this dataframe from a CSV file to be combined with other datasets in the future.\n",

    "Steps Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read CSV File\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and save `shootings.csv` into a data frame using `pd.read_csv()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Initial Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Column renaming, removal, change of data types were performed. Original column `date_` did not following naming convention of the data set and was updated \n",
    "to `date`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns `the geom`, `the_geom_webmercator`, `dc_key`, and `code` were redundant and removed. A function `remove_col` was created to removed the \n",
    "aforementoined columns at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Columns `officer_involved`, `offender_injured`, and `offender_deceased` used Y/N coding initially. They were changed into 1/0 coding so that there was a \n",
    "consistent coding format for all binary variables. Six binary variable (`inside`, `outside`, `fatal`, and the aforementioned) were recoded into True/False coding to adopt boolean data type using function `convert_to_bool`. The process was limited by null values because they cannot be presented as boolean data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Date and Time Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time data were captured in `date` and `time` columns in string format. A `datetime` column (datetime format) was created together with `month`,\n",
    "`day` (day of month) and `hour` (hour of day) columns to allow users group data by these factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Longitude and Latitude Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains two sets of longitude (`lng`, `point_x`) and latitude (`lat`, `point_y`) information. With the initial intention to select one column\n",
    "for each variable, a function `verify_lat_lng` was created to compute the degree difference between the two. While most differences are relatively small, all\n",
    "variables are retained to allow future users to make an informed decision and compare with external sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Standardize Wound Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the wound data was mannually entered to the system, there was no standard format of the info. Capitalization, mispelling, abbreviations, use\n",
    "of plural/ single forms were some of the identified problems. After turning all values into lower case and filling up null values with an empty string,\n",
    "module `textblob` was utitlized to standardize wound column. A text file `bodyparts.txt` with common bodyparts seen in the dataset was created to train \n",
    "`textblob` to correct and standardize wounds. There were initially 125 different values in `wound` and evenutally 54 values in the final data set. \n",
    "Future users can update the training file according to their needs to improve the standardization process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Export Data in CSV Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the data frame was saved into a csv format to the local machine using `to_csv` function. \n",
    "\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concatenation\n",
    "After all the datasets were cleaned, it was determined that they could not be combined together. There was no clear join point for all the datasets. Each dataset had multiple missing values so, even when joined, there would be many NULL column values. \n",

    "# Future Work\n",
    "Machine learning analysis could be used on scraped articles dataset\n",
    "* Words and phrases that probabilistically lead to relevant articles include “shooting”, “guns”, “shots”, “murdered”, “gang”, “drug deal”, “dangerous”, “police-involved”, “stray bullet”, “shot over”, “suspects”, “homicide”, “gunmen”, “shooting”, “turf war”, and “gunfire”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing could be used on scraped articles\n",
    "* NLP models could be trained using a set of articles known to provide information about gun violence. The model could then identify relevant information about gun violence in upcoming articles without those articles being directly identified as articles about gun violence.\n",
